    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./


## Reflection

### Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

- The "P" for proportional means that the car will steer in proportion to the cross-track error, or CTE. CTE is essentially how far from the middle line of the road the car.This proportional portion of the controller tries to steer the car toward the center line (against the cross-track error). However, if the coefficient is set too high for P, the car will oscillate a lot, as the car will constantly overcorrect and overshoot the middle. If the coefficient is too low, the car may react too slowly to curves when the car gets off-center with a higher CTE.If used alone, the car overshoots the central line very easily and go out of the road very quickly. 

- The "I" for integral sums up all CTEs up to that point, such that too many negative CTEs (in this case, meaning the car has been to the left of the middle of the lane for awhile) will drive up this value, causing the car to turn back toward the middle, preventing the car from driving on one side of the lane the whole time. The integral portion tries to eliminate a possible system bias in the steering or throttle actuator  system that could prevent the error to be eliminated. If used , it makes the car to turn with a big steering angle for large time making it turn into circles. In the case of the simulator, no bias is present. 

- The "D" for derivate is the change in CTE from one value to the next. The differential portion helps to counteract the proportional trend to overshoot the center line by smoothing the approach to it. 

### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

The parameters were chosen manually by try and error.For this purpose a addictive factor of +-0.5 is considered. First, make sure the car can drive straight with zero as parameters. Then add the proportional and the car start going on following the road but it starts overshooting go out of it. Then add the differential to try to overcome the overshooting. The integral part only moved the car out of the road; so, it stayed as zero. After the car drove the track without going out of it, the parameters increased to minimize the average cross-track error on a single track lap. The final parameters where [P: 1.5, I: 0.0, D: 2.5].
